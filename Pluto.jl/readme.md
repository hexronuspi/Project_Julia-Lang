This contains usage of a noteboook called Pluto.jl which gives us an interactive view of the code.
### Setup the Pluto.jl Notebook : 

## Step 1: Install Julia 1.9.3

1. Go to [Julia Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads) and download the current stable release, which is Julia 1.9.3.

## Step 2: Run Julia

After installing Julia, make sure you can run it. The process may vary depending on your operating system.

- On some systems, this means searching for the ‚ÄúJulia 1.9‚Äù program installed on your computer.
- On other systems, it means running the command `julia` in a terminal.

## Step 3: Install Pluto

In the Julia terminal, type the following command to install the Pluto package using Julia's package manager:

```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")

## Step 4: Run Pluto

In the Julia terminal, start Pluto by typing:

import Pluto; Pluto.run()

Pluto will automatically open your browser when it's ready. üéâ
