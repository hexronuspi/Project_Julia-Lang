### Step 2: Run Julia

After installing Julia, make sure you can run it. The process may vary depending on your operating system.

## Future Work

In the future, the .html files will be available live at [https://hexronuspi.github.io/Portfolio/project.html](https://hexronuspi.github.io/Portfolio/project.html). They will be integrated so that you can use them without the need to download or perform any initial setup.
